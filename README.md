This repository is a backup of most dot files that I use for my current Arch Linux install. This makes it easier to share my setup amongst friends. Also, in the case that something breaks I can easily restore it to a previous
commit. The following are the current applications I am using on my machine:

| Type | Application |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Shell | zsh 5.8 |
| WM | i3 |
| Terminal | termite |
| Text Editor | nvim |
| Browser | brave |
| PDF Reader | mupdf | 
| File Manager | ranger |
| Compositor | picom |
